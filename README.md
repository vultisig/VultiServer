# Vultisigner
`Vultisigner`, also known as `VultiServer`, is a simple TSS server providing Keygen, Keysign, and Reshare services. Use cases for VultiServer include:

1. Front-end applications that can't integrate with [mobile-tss-lib](https://github.com/vultisig/mobile-tss-lib) will use VultiServer as a TSS server.
2. Fast Vault: Allows creating a 2/2 vault with one mobile device, with VultiServer as the second party. Users can sign transactions with one device.
3. Fast Vault with 2/3: Allows creating a 2/3 vault with two mobile devices and VultiServer as one party. Users can sign transactions with either mobile device without relying on VultiServer to access their crypto assets.

Vultisigner / VultiServer consists of two components:
- API Server: An HTTP server that handles keygen and keysign requests from clients.
- TSS Worker: A service triggered by the API Server to perform the actual TSS operations.

# API Server
## Ping
`/ping` , it provide a simple health check for the Api Server , the return value is `Vultisigner is running`

## Keygen
`POST` `/vault/create`
### Keygen Request
```json
{
  "name": "My Vault",
  "session_id": "session id for key generation",
  "hex_encryption_key": "hex encoded encryption key",
  "hex_chain_code": "hex encoded chain code",
  "local_party_id": "local party id",
  "encryption_password": "password to encryption the generated vault share",
  "email": "email of the user",
  "lib_type": "type of the library"
}
```
- name: Vault name
- session_id: Key generation session ID (random UUID)
- hex_chain_code: 32-byte hex encoded string
- hex_encryption_key: 32-byte hex encoded string for encryption/decryption
- local_party_id: Identifier for VultiServer in the keygen session
- encryption_password: Password to encrypt the vault share
- email: Email to send the encrypted vault share
- lib_type: Type of the library (e.g., 0 for GG20 , 1 for DKLS)
- 
### Response

Status Code: OK

## Keysign
`POST` `/vault/sign` , it is used to sign a transaction

### Keysign Request
```json
{
  "public_key": "ECDSA public key of the vault",
  "messages": [
    "hex encoded message 1",
    "hex encoded message 2",
    "hex encoded message N"
  ], 
  "session": "session id for this key sign", 
  "hex_encryption_key": "hex encoded encryption key",
  "derive_path": "derive path for the key sign",
  "is_ecdsa": "is the key sign ECDSA or not",
  "vault_password": "password to decrypt the vault share"
}
```
- public_key: ECDSA public key of the vault
- messages: Hex encoded messages to be signed
- session_id: Key sign session ID (random UUID)
- hex_encryption_key: 32-byte hex encoded string for encryption/decryption
- derive_path: Derive path for the key sign (e.g., BITCOIN: m/44'/0'/0'/0/0)
- is_ecdsa: Boolean indicating if the key sign is for ECDSA
- vault_password: Password to decrypt the vault share

## Get Vault
`GET` `/vault/get/{publicKeyECDSA}` , this endpoint allow user to get the vault information

Note: please set `x-password` header with the password to decrypt the vault share , if the password is empty or incorrect, server will return an error
### Response
```json
{
  "name": "vault name",
  "public_key_ecdsa": "ECDSA public key of the vault",
  "public_key_eddsa": "EdDSA public key of the vault",
  "hex_chain_code": "hex encoded chain code",
  "local_party_id": "local party id"
}
```

## Reshare
`POST` `/vault/reshare` , this endpoint allow user to reshare the vault share

### Reshare Request
```json
{
  "name": "My Vault",
  "public_key": "ECDSA public key of the vault",
  "session_id": "session id for key generation",
  "hex_encryption_key": "hex encoded encryption key",
  "hex_chain_code": "hex encoded chain code",
  "local_party_id": "local party id",
  "old_parties": ["old party id 1", "old party id 2"], 
  "encryption_password": "password to encryption the generated vault share",
  "email": "email of the user",
  "old_reshare_prefix":"old reshare prefix",
  "lib_type": "type of the library"
}
```
- name: Vault name
- public_key: ECDSA public key
- session_id: Reshare session ID (random UUID)
- hex_encryption_key: 32-byte hex encoded string for encryption/decryption
- hex_chain_code: 32-byte hex encoded string
- local_party_id: Identifier for VultiServer in the reshare session
- old_parties: List of old party IDs
- encryption_password: Password to encrypt the vault share
- email: Email to send the encrypted vault share
- lib_type: Type of the library (e.g., 0 for GG20 , 1 for DKLS)

## Resend vault share and verification code
`POST` `/vault/resend` , this endpoint allow user to resend the vault share and verification code
Note: user can only request a resend every three minutes

### Resend Request
```json
{
  "public_key_ecdsa": "ECDSA public key of the vault",
  "password": "password to decrypt the vault share",
  "email": "email of the user"
}
```
## Verify code
`GET` `/vault/verify/:public_key_ecdsa/:code` , this endpoint allow user to verify the code
if server return http status code 200, it means the code is valid , other status code means the code is invalid

### Migrate Request
```json
{
  "public_key": "ECDSA public key of the vault",
  "session_id": "session id for key generation",
  "hex_encryption_key": "hex encoded encryption key",
  "encryption_password": "password to encryption the generated vault share",
  "email": "email of the user"
}
```
- public_key: ECDSA public key
- session_id: Reshare session ID (random UUID)
- hex_encryption_key: 32-byte hex encoded string for encryption/decryption
- encryption_password: Password to encrypt the vault share
- email: Email to send the encrypted vault share
